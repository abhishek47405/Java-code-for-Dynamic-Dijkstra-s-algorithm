# Java-code-for-Dynamic-Dijkstra-s-algorithm
In modern systems, edge weights often fluctuate due to factors such as traffic congestion, bandwidth variation, or environmental conditions. Furthermore, in many cases, the edge weights are best represented as probability distributions rather than fixed values. Existing algorithms fail to efficiently handle these dynamic and probabilistic scenarios.
Proposed Solution:-

Probabilistic Edge Weights: Each edge weight is modeled as a probability distribution.
Dynamic Updates: When edge weights change, the algorithm recalculates only the affected paths, avoiding full recomputation.
This approach ensures efficient computation of shortest paths under uncertainty and dynamic conditions, making it suitable for real-time systems.
